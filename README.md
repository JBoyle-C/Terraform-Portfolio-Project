# Terraform-Portfolio-Project
Terrafrom Portfolio Project to demonstrate use cases in a real world scenario for a client.

Scenario Overview
Client: James Smith, a freelance web designer

Project: Portfolio Website Deployment

Project Description:  James Smith, a freelance web designer, wants to showcase his work and attract potential clients through an online portfolio. He has designed a modern, responsive single-page website using the Next.js framework. James requires this website to be hosted on a robust, scalable, and cost-effective platform. Additionally, the website needs to be highly available and deliver fast loading times for a global audience.

Problem Statement :
James needs his portfolio website to be:

Highly Available: The website should be accessible to users worldwide with minimal downtime.
Scalable: As his portfolio gains traction, the hosting solution should handle increased traffic without performance degradation.
Cost-Effective: Hosting costs should be optimized, avoiding unnecessary expenses.
Fast Loading: The website should load quickly for visitors, providing a seamless user experience.
Given these requirements, deploying the website using AWS services such as S3 for static hosting and CloudFront for content delivery is an ideal solution
